Mega Man X4 Practice Hack v0.01 (For Zero 100% and X 100%)
-------------------------------

Controls:
---------
Stage Select
------------
Select: 
Flag a Maverick as defeated. You will have all upgrades found in that stage.
NOTE: There is a special case for X. You will not have the upgrades from
Dragoon's stage unless you are in Mushroom, Peacock, Space Port, Final Weapon 1,
or Final Weapon 2. This is to account for the revisit after Beast.

Holding L1 while selecting stage:
Brings you to part 2 of that Maverick's stage.
Going to part 2 of a Maverick stage will give you
the upgrades found in Part 1, if any.

Holding R1 while selecting stage:
Brings you do an alternative stage based on this mapping:
Spider   -> Intro stage, part 1
Walrus   -> Final Weapon 2, part 2
Mushroom -> Final Weapon 1, part 2
Dragoon  -> Space Port
Stingray -> Final Weapon 1, part 1
Peacock  -> Intro stage, part 2
Owl      -> Colonel fight (X only)
Beast    -> Final Weapon 2, part 1

Gameplay:
---------
Select+Left, Select+Right:
Decrement or increment the saved checkpoint.
You have infinite lives, so the lives counter shows the current
saved checkpoint instead.

Select+Up:
Refills your health, tanks, and weapon energy.

Select+R2:
Save your current hearts, tanks, and armor upgrades. This allows you to
go back to a previous item state when loading to checkpoint.
A noise plays when your save was successful.

Select+L2:
Load to the currently saved checkpoint. If items were set with Select+R2,
they will be restored. If not, you will be given the items you originally
obtained when starting the stage.
Your health, weapon energy, and tanks will be refilled.

The WARNING sirens before boss fights have been removed.

The Final Sigma fight is infinite. Once you destroy a form, it will respawn again with full health after the next phase.

Pause Menu:
-----------
You can escape from every stage instead of just completed stages.

Final Weapon 2, part 1 (refights):
----------------------------------
Capsules are not deactivated after killing a Maverick.
Your character's position is slightly different after returning
from a refight so as to not immediately re-enter the capsule.
The center capsule is always activated.
